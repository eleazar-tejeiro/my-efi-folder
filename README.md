# My setup Hackintosh

Mobo: Asus Prime P-II Z370
Processor: Intel 9400-F
Graphics: Radeon 580X 8GB
RAM: 16GB

I have an DSDT, not full patchet but, almost done. Works well for me with Auto-Merge when it's in Drop-All OEM tables, kernel panic on boot.
My processor doesn't have Intel Graphic Aceleration, so the Radeon makes all the work.

Everything it's working until now, sometimes I have laggy after wake up from hibernation, but it's not all the times.

- Audio
- Video
- HEVC & H264 Acceleration with radeon
- My processor power ssdt.
- Wi-Fi (Using USB adapter TP-Link)
- USB ports patched (with DSDT)

I would like to upgrade to OpenCore but I still have to read a lot and try to fix some bugs on DSDT.

PD: Thnx to Olarila, without them I couldn't finish my setup.
